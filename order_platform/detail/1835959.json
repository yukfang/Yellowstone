This doesn&#39;t seem right and I am wondering what their setup is/intention behind the setup. Ideally in a dual channel setup where the same event is firing on both browser and server, we would expect to see roughly the same number of events from each channel. e.g. on 1-23 we saw over 1400 server Complete Reg events and only 156 browser events</li><li>I would also note that the raw number of events is a bit inconsistent. We saw a total of 13K events on 1-22 down to 1.8K for 1-23 and 14K on 1-24</li><li>Digging deeper and looking at the events in our data table I can&#39;t really pinpoint what might be causing the low deduplication rate. We are receiving event IDs for both browser and server Complete Registration events and the values we are receiving appear to be similar (random string of numbers and letters).&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Next steps: I think for us to resolve their event deduplication issue I need a better understanding of how they have the Complete Registration event set up to fire on both the browser and server side. Along with that hopefully we can discover why the events seem to fluctuate so much in terms of raw numbers as well. </p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps you could start an email chain where I can correspond with the client team?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Regards,</p><p>Thomas</p>",

The event counts in either the browser or server rows are unmatched and outside of that group.&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong><em>Or should it be zero since there can be no matching against Browser events since there are none.</em></strong> E.g. on Match 8th we received only browser events which is why the matched event count was 0 (no server events&nbsp;to match/deduplicate against)</span></li></ul><li><span style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong><em>Can you send us a listing of all event_ids sent on a particular day by the Pixel,&nbsp;ideally with a timestamp?</em></strong> Attached is a spreadsheet with a sampling of browser side Complete Registration events from the past week. All columns/data that could be used to track back to a user has been removed. event_id(s) and timestamps are included.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">As for next steps: can we loop in someone on the front-end that may be able to provide context on the browser side Complete Registration configuration and event counts?
